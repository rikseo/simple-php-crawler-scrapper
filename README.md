simple-php-crawler-scrapper
===========================

a simple php based crawler that i have written to learn how to automate scrapping data from certain pages.

Install Instructions
===========================

1. import database_structure.sql in mysql using phpmyadmin or other such tool.

2. copy all files to a directory in your testing server's root directory.

3. change config.php to change database credentials.

4. import sample.sql to add sample data to your crawler. or add your own entries to source table.

5. launch index.php to fetch pages and parse data

6. don't ever ask for support. I created it just for learning. this is NOT a public service.
